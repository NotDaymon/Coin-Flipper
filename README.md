# Overview

Easy one click coin toss for when you need to settle an argument or are trying to decide on what to eat for lunch, and you don't have a coin near by!

# Why

Honestly out of boredom. I often like to pick random "issues" that could be solved by engineering, and solve them for fun.

# Features

* Simple one click coin toss with an alert of the result
* Streak tracker for how many times you've flipped a specific result in a row
* Clean and modern UI
* Smooth and natural feeling animation bar to expand the window and allow access to advanced settings
* A scrollable log for previous flips and results
* A clear log option
* A toggle to speed up the coin toss
