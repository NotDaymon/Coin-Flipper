# Overview

Easy one click coin toss for when you need to settle an argument or are trying to decide on what to eat for lunch, and you don't have a coin near by!

# Why

Honestly out of boredom. I often like to pick random "issues" that could be solved by engineering, and solve them for fun.

# Features

* Simple one click coin toss with an alert of the result
* Streak tracker for how many times you've flipped a specific result in a row
* Clean and modern UI
* Smooth and natural feeling animation bar to expand the window and allow access to advanced settings
* A scrollable log for previous flips and results
* A clear log option
* A toggle to speed up the coin toss

# Issues
* I'd like to note that the code for this project is not entirely-industry approved. Theres coding practices I utilize that are a bit behind the curve, and I'd like for you to keep that in mind when reading the source code. My future projects will almost always be industry-approved, but this project I didn't care too much for coding practices and the like.
